A simple Python project that simulates a bus race in the terminal using ASCII art, loops, and randomness.
# bus-race-ascii

A terminal-based Python project that simulates a bus race using ASCII art.

The race represents two local buses:
- **Bus Centro Medellín**
- **Bus Bello**

Each bus advances randomly until one reaches the finish line.

## Features

- ASCII art animation in the terminal
- Randomized movement using Python's `random` module
- Simple control flow with loops and functions
- Cross-platform console clearing (Windows / Unix)

---

## How to run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

```bash
python carrera_buses.py

Purpose
This project was created as a learning exercise to practice:
Loops and conditionals
Functions
Basic simulation logic
Terminal-based visual output
